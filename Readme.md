## Description

Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time. 
After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses.

Also there is a option to either guess a single letter or a whole word , but the latter will result in a lose of 2 lives as compared to traditional 1 live on each wrong letter guessed.
